# Final-Project
## Note Tracking Truck
Tracking the marks on the floor; recognize what color it is and produce the sound that related to the color.

## Summary

The goal of this project is to convert colors into sound tracks, to create a environment for students to interact with their campus. The truck will be loaded with three color sensor, one for recognize colored sticker two for tracing the black marked tracks, a speaker for producing sound, tow motors and four wheels. 

This truck will follow the two black marked lines on the floor, in the middle of these two line, you can place several colored sticker. This truck will goes along the black lines and recognize every single stickers’ color and produce a sound that link to that color. At end of the black lines, I will place a white square on each side indicate changing direction; this truck will return by the way it came.Students in the campus are welcome to put colored sticker on the floor and create their only sound combination.  

## Component Parts
From what pieces will you build your project? Will you build or buy those pieces?
Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use, and a block diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

For truck:

Wheels x2

Motors x2 

Motor shield? 

Wires 

color sensors x3

speaker x1 check our from the lab.

transistor x1  for control the motors going forward or going backward.

resistor ？？ How much Ohms?

wooden truck body—laser cut?

battery

switch

IR Proximity sensor??

QTR-8RC Reflectance Sensor(Pololu)??  not sure wich one I should get yet.

## Challenges
* How can I turn the wheel slightly to right or left? (Make sure the truck go along the track)
* How long should I stay at the same spot so that the sensor can recognize the current colored sticker before this truck move forward.
* How can I control the speed of this truck? 
* TIME-CONSUMING PART: coding: what colors match with what notes? How can I code it?
    * truck moving pattern: move forward, meet a color, recognize the color, produce the sound(note) that is related to this color, keep moving forward, if meet white sticker, return by the way it came and repeat the same pattern.

*  If I put the color sensor underneath the truck, will it effect the process of recognizing color? If yes, where else I can put this sensor?

## Timeline
* Week 1: Write proposal
* Week 2: experiencing different parts
    * Build up the truck that is able to move backward and forward. also can turn right of left.
    * add color sensor, experiencing what color is more recognizable? How long it takes to recognize a color? 
    * install the speaker, make some sounds.
* Week 3: coding 
    * match the colors with specific notes
    * build up the truck moving pattern
* Week 4: testing and adjusting
    * keep building up the moving pattern, testing it out and adjusting.
    * install the truck moving track around our campus, cut out colored stickers, and see how CCA students interact with it.
* Week 5: Present!
